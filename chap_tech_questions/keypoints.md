## Data Structures
### 1. Vectors/ArrayLists
A collection of elements which are stored in sequence by index.
### 2. Linked Lists
A list that are made up of a series of connecting nodes. Within each node, there exists a pointer to the next node (for double linked list, a node also contains a pointer to the last node). 
### 3. Trees, Tries, & Graphs
Tree: a binary data structure with a root node and certain amount of subnodes that make up for its subtree.
Tries???
Graph: a data structures used to represent graph, which is made up of nodes and edges. 
### 4. Stacks & Queues
Stack: FILO
Queues: FIFO
### 5. Heaps
???
### 7. Hash Tables
